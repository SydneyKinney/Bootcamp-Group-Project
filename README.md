### Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps

### Presentation (Elena)
- Topic:  Number of installs vs price/ratings
- Reason why: We want to see if there is a correlation 
- Description of their source of data: This files contains Application data of more than 600K applications with the 23 attributes.
- Questions we hope to answer: 
1) Does price/ratings affect installations? And in which way?
2) What are the top 10 categories?
3) What are the top 10 installed categories?
4) What is the number of downloads depending on the price?
5) Does ad support have a impact on the rating of the app?
6) What impact does reviews have on installs?

### GitHub (Sydney)
- Description of the communication protocals: weekly via Slack and Zoom (outside and inside of class)
- One branch per team member: SQL(Daniel), Database(Vera), GitHub(Sydney), Machine Learning(Elena)
- Create new branches and deleting old branches as we move throughout our project


### Machine Learning Model (Vera)
- As we are analysing a regression and not a classification problem we are going to use one of the models which can analyse linear regression.
- We are assuming that we will use Supervised learning with Linear regression (multiple linear regressions).
- Linear regression had a very low accuracy score so we are trying random forest.

### Database (Daniel)
- AWS
- pgAdmin

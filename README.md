### Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps

### Presentation (Elena)
- Topic:  Number of installs vs price/ratings
- Reason why: We want to see if there is a correlation 
- Description of their source of data: This files contains Application data of more than 600K applications with the 23 attributes.
- Questions we hope to answer: Does price/ratings affect installations? And in which way?

### GitHub (Sydney)
- Description of the communication protocals: weekly via Slack and Zoom (outside and inside of class)
- One branch per team member: SQL(Daniel), Database(Vera), GitHub(Sydney), Machine Learning(Elena)

### Machine Learning Model (Vera)
- As we are analysing a regression and not a classification problem we are going to use one of the models which can analyse linear regression.
- We are assuming that we will use Supervised learning with Linear regression (multiple linear regressions).

### Database (Daniel)
(add Technology.md)

### Next Steps
- Clean data
- Preliminary data preprocessing
- Analysis phase

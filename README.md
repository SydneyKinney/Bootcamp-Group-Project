# Google App Store Analysis

## Overview  
- Main topic: Number of installs vs price/ratings
- Why: We want to see if there is a correlation 
- Description of the source of data: This files contains Application data of more than 600K applications with the 23 attributes

#### Questions we hope to answer: 
- Does price/ratings affect installations? And in which way?
- What are the top 10 categories?
- What are the top 10 installed categories?
- What is the number of downloads depending on the price?
- Does ad support have a impact on the rating of the app?
- What impact does reviews have on installs?

## Process

#### Machine Learning Model 
- As we are analysing a regression and not a classification problem we are going to use one of the models which can analyse linear regression.
- We are assuming that we will use Supervised learning with Linear regression (multiple linear regressions).
- Linear regression had a very low accuracy score. We will try to do some more cleaning and analysis of a feature importancy, after we will try to build a different machine learning models to compare scores.

#### Machine Learning Model (Need to complete)
- Description of data preprocessing
- Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the decision-making process
- Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
- Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
- Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables)
- Description of how they have trained the model thus far, and any additional training that will take place
- Description of current accuracy score

#### Database 
- AWS
- pgAdmin

#### Language
- Python
